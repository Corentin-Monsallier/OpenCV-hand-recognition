- Integrating computer vision with mini-games

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.10
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Mediapipe (optional, for advanced hand tracking)

## 📂 Projects

### 1. Hand and Finger Counter

- Detects and counts visible hands and fingers.
- Configurable maximum number of hands.

### 2. Paint with Finger Painting

- Draw on the screen using fingers as virtual brushes.
- Change brush types and use an eraser.

### 3. French Sign Language Alphabet Reader

- Recognizes letters of the French Sign Language alphabet.
- Displays the detected letters in real-time.
